# Supported Versions

According to platform third party support policy now we are supporting deploy in Kubernetes N +- 2.

Current recommended Kubernetes version is `1.26.x`, so we support:

| Kubernetes version     | Status of `0.48.0`    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| `1.24.x`               | Tested                |
| `1.25.x`               | Tested                |
| `1.26.x` (recommended) | Tested                |
| `1.27.x`               | Forward compatibility |
| `1.28.x`               | Forward compatibility |

**Note:** `Forward compatibility` means that the latest version don't use any Kubernetes APIs that will be remove
in next Kubernetes versions. All Kubernetes APIs verified by official documentation
[Deprecated API Migration Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/)

**Note:** OpenShift 4.x based on Kubernetes and regularly picks up new Kubernetes releases. So compatibility with
OpenShift you can track by Kubernetes version. To understand which Kubernetes version OpenShift use you can read
it release notes. For example, `OpenShift 4.12` based on `Kubernetes v1.25.0` about which wrote in
[Release notes](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes.html).

If we will consider support by types of Clouds we can create the following table:

| Clouds                                   | `0.48.0` |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- |
| AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (AWS EKS) | ✓        |
| Azure Kubernetes                         | ✓        |
| Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)           | ✓        |
| On-premise Kubernetes >= 1.25            | ✓        |
| On-premise OpenShift >= 4.10             | ✓        |

# Versioning

This section describes how Monitoring components and API versioning.

## Components

For versioning all components we are using `Semantic Versioning` (SemVer).

It means that a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:

* `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes,
* `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
* `PATCH` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

More information about SemVer you can find by link [https://semver.org](https://semver.org/).

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

## Kubernetes API

Except of components we also provide Kubernetes API, such as Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).
Kubernetes API (and CRDs in particular) usually versioning as described in
[The Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-groups-and-versioning).

**Note**: If you want to deploy the `monitoring-operator` into **Kubernetes v1.15** or lower or
**OpenShift v3.11** or lower, you must work with _v1beta1_ CRDs manually. For more information see
[Maintenance Guide: Work with legacy CRDs](maintenance.md#work-with-legacy-crds).

For example different Kubernetes API can cycle from alpha to release with versions:

* `/<api>/v1alpha1`
* `/<api>/v1beta1`
* `/<api>/v1`

**Note**: The versions may be different, not only those that were listed above.

One important point of the deployment is associated with versioning the CRDs.

Helm doesn't have an ability to update/remove CRDs, but can create them. It means that CRDs will
create during first deploy. But during any updates and remove deployment Helm will not update or remove CRDs.

For more details you can read [Issue: CRD update during helm upgrade](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/8668) and
[Design: CRD Handling in Helm](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/f9e06c16d89ccea1bea77c01a6a96ae3b309f823/architecture/crds.md).

So during the update, you need to manually update all CRDs. For more information, refer to
[Maintenance Guide: Update Procedure](maintenance.md#update-procedure).

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

# Prerequisites

This section describes which prerequisites should be checked before deploy Monitoring.

## Before You Begin

* Verify that you have cloud with Kubernetes 1.19+ or OpenShift 3.11+ versions.
* Verify that you use CLI `kubectl` 1.19+ or `oc` 3.11+.
* Verify that you use Helm 3.0+.
* Verify that namespace is already created before the installation.
* Verify that you have enough rights to deploy in the target project: [Permissions](#permissions)
* Verify the hardware requirements: [Hardware Sizing](hardware-sizing.md)
* Verify the installation parameters. The list of parameters is available in [Inventory](#inventory).

Also it is important to note the following:

* If you disable automation [CRD upgrade](#crd-upgrade) you need to apply ALL [CRDs](./crds) before installation.
* If you want to update your deployment firstly read [Maintenance Guide: Update Procedure](maintenance.md#update-procedure).
* If you have Pod Security Policy Restricted by default on namespace, it can lead to unreachable `node-exporter` pods.
  Then you need to add privileged PSP ClusterRole to ServiceAccount `<namespace>-node-exporter`.
* If another prometheus/victoriametrics was installed before, for example, default prometheus/victoriametrics
  in `monitoring` namespace, which is included in Kubernetes, you need to check its `namespaces` scope.
  Add to another prometheus/victoriametrics-operator Deployment restriction on namespaces  `- '--namespaces=monitoring'`.

  ```yaml
  containers:
    - args:
      - '--kubelet-service=kube-system/kubelet'
      - '--namespaces=monitoring'
        ...
  ```

* If you deploy on OpenShift, verify that the namespace has empty `node-selector`.

  ```bash
  $ oc describe namespace <namespace>
  Name:         <namespace>
  Labels:       <none>
  Annotations:  openshift.io/description=
                openshift.io/display-name=
                openshift.io/node-selector=
                openshift.io/requester=admin
                openshift.io/sa.scc.mcs=s0:c16,c15
                openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups=1000270000/10000
                openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range=1000270000/10000
  Status:        Active
  ```

### AWS

In case of using Persistence Volume in AWS for VictoriaMetrics or Prometheus we **recommended** use `AWS EBS`.

#### AWS EBS persistence volume

Selecting between `AWS EBS` disk types you should select at least HDD with type `Throughput Optimized HDD volumes`.

For Prometheus we recommended use SSD volumes.
For VictoriaMetrics you can use at least HDD with type `Throughput Optimized HDD volumes`. If you want you also cause
SSD volumes.

About `AWS EBS` disk types you can read in the documentation
[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html).

#### AWS EFS persistence volume

**Warning!** Prometheus **doesn't support** non-POSIX compliant storages and **we strongly doesn't recommended**
try to install on `AWS EFS`. Prometheus work very bad with all NFS-like storages and especially with `AWS EFS`.
Information about NFS in the official documentation
[https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#operational-aspects](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#operational-aspects).

VictoriaMetrics officially support all volume types, see a documentation
[https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#prominent-features](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#prominent-features).

But if you want use `AWS EFS` you must plan you volume by throughput. You shouldn't use volume with `Bursting`
throughput type. Need to select `Provisioned Throughput` mode for EFS volume or at least `Elastic Throughput`.
The first option will charge some additional money. Minimal value of `Provisioned Throughput` is 10 Mb/s
(of course better to use much more).

## Permissions

The `monitoring-operator` service account requires ClusterRole and permissions for a lot of Cluster APIs because the
following roles work through ClusterRole, and the operator should have the ability to create ClusterRole and
ClusterRoleBinding resources.

Components for which ClusterRoles are created by default:

* `prometheus`
* `prometheus-operator`
* `grafana-operator`
* `kube-state-metrics`
* `node-exporter`
* `cert-exporter`
* `cloudwatch-exporter`
* `configuration-streamer`
* `network-latency-exporter`
* `prometheus-adapter-operator`
* `version-exporter`
* `vmoperator`

Thus a ClusterRole of `monitoring-operator` should include a set of all the required permissions from all ClusterRoles
that `monitoring-operator` creates during the deploy.

Also the `monitoring-operator` supports to deploy with restricted privileges when the operator has access only to
resources inside the namespace and restricted access to cluster scoped resources. In this case, all the necessary
privileges for cluster scoped resources and resources in another namespaces must be granted manually before the deploy.

## Hardware Requirements

### Overall Minimal Requirements

The overall hardware requirements can be calculated as sum of requirements for the platform monitoring components:

* `alertmanager` resources
* `grafana` resources
* `grafana-operator` resources
* `kube-state-metrics` resources
* `monitoring-operator` resources
* `node-exporter` resources multiplied by number of nodes in cluster
* `victoriametris` resources calculated for specific system load
* `vm-operator` resources

The **minimal** recommended hardware requirements for average system is:

| Resource | Requirement |
| -------- | ----------- |
| CPU      | 3000m       |
| RAM      | 3000Mi      |
| IOPS     | -           |
| Storage  | 10GB        |

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

### Detailed Hardware Requirements

Monitoring can be deployed in various schemes and with additional components for integrations. Also it can collect
various metrics count, and different components can use a different number of resources.

There is a separate guide [Hardware Sizing](hardware-sizing.md) if you need to calculate
the exact amount of resources for each component.

# Inventory

This section describes how to create an inventory and which parameters are used to deploy Monitoring stack in one form
or another.

## Basic Components

Monitoring includes a lot of components which can execute various functions. But not all projects need all functions. So
before installing Monitoring into the inventory, the components that should be installed can be specified.

There is only one component that is always installed: `monitoring-operator`

The default configuration is:

* `monitoring-operator`
* `alertmanager`
* `grafana`
* `grafana-operator`
* `kube-state-metrics`
* `node-exporter`
* `victoriametrics`
* `vm-operator`

The available components for enabling/disabling are:

* [`alertmanager`](#alertmanager)
* Prometheus:
  * [`prometheus-operator`](#prometheus-operator)
  * [`prometheus`](#prometheus)
  * [`prometheus rules`](#prometheus-rules)
  * [`kubernetes monitors`](#kubernetes-monitors)
* Grafana:
  * [`grafana-operator`](#grafana-operator)
  * [`grafana`](#grafana)
  * [`grafana dashboards`](#grafana-dashboards)
* [`pushgateway`](#pushgateway)
* Exporters:
  * [`node-exporter`](#node-exporter)
  * [`kube-state-metrics`](#kube-state-metrics)
  * [`blackbox-exporter`](#blackbox-exporter)
  * [`cert-exporter`](#cert-exporter)
  * [`version-exporter`](#version-exporter)
  * [`network-latency-exporter`](#network-latency-exporter)
  * [`cloudwatch-exporter`](#cloudwatch-exporter) (for AWS public cloud)
  * [`promitor`](#promitor-agent-scraper) (for Azure public cloud)
  * [`stackdriver-exporter`](#stackdriver-exporter) (for Google public cloud)
* [`promxy`](#promxy)
* Prometheus-adapter:
  * [`prometheus-adapter-operator`](#prometheus-adapter-operator)
  * [`prometheus-adapter`](#prometheus-adapter)
* [`graphite-remote-adapter`](#graphite-remote-adapter)
* [`configuration-streamer`](#configurations-streamer)
* VictoriaMetrics stack:
  * [`vmoperator`](#vmoperator)
  * [`vmagent`](#vmagent)
  * [`vmalert`](#vmalert)
  * [`vmalertmanager`](#vmalertmanager)
  * [`vmauth`](#vmauth)
  * [`vmsingle`](#vmsingle)
  * [`vmuser`](#vmuser)

You can install these components in various combinations.

But the most common deployment options can have the following combined scenarios:

* Deploy Monitoring only for collect metrics.
* Deploy Monitoring for collect and watch metrics.
* Deploy Monitoring for collect metrics, watch them, and alert them states.
* Deploy Monitoring for collect metrics and send them to external storage.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

### Default deploy settings

Monitoring can be deploy without specifying any parameters for deploy. Even if you will specify any parameters
for all other parameters will be using defaults from `values.yaml` file.

By default Monitoring deploy with components:

| Component             | Requests                | Limits                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `alertmanager`        | CPU: 100m, RAM 100Mi    | CPU: 200m, RAM: 200Mi   |
| `grafana`             | CPU: 300m, RAM: 400Mi   | CPU: 500m, RAM: 800Mi   |
| `grafana-operator`    | CPU: 50m, RAM: 50Mi     | CPU: 100m, RAM: 100Mi   |
| `kube-state-metrics`  | CPU: 50m, RAM: 50Mi     | CPU: 100m, RAM: 256Mi   |
| `monitoring-operator` | CPU: 50m, RAM: 50Mi     | CPU: 100m, RAM: 150Mi   |
| `node-exporter`       | CPU: 50m, RAM: 50Mi     | CPU: 100m, RAM: 100Mi   |
| `victoriametris`      | CPU: 1000m, RAM 3 Gi    | CPU: 1500m, RAM: 5Gi    |
| `vm-operator`         | CPU: 100m, RAM: 100Mi   | CPU: 200m, RAM: 200Mi   |
| **Total**             | CPU: 1700m, RAM: 3872Mi | CPU: 2800m, RAM: 6926Mi |

**Note**: We are strongly recommending check these requests and limits, and change if necessary for your environment.

Also by default:

* Victoriametrics and Grafana will deploy with **ephemeral storage** (with using emptyDir)
* Victoriametrics will collect and store metrics **24 hours**
* Victoriametrics will collect metrics from (full list see in documents [Metrics OOB](defaults/metrics.md))
  * Kubelet and cAdviser
  * Kubernetes APIServer
  * Nginx Ingress
  * Etcd
  * Kube-state-metrics
  * Node Exporter
  * Self metrics: Victoriametrics, AlertManager, Grafana
* In Grafana will create dashboards, dashboard list and descriptions see in documents [Dashboard OOB](defaults/dashboards/)
* In Victoriametrics will create alerts, list of alerts see in
  document [Alerts OOB](defaults/alerts.md)
* Without any ingress (in case deploy in Kubernetes)
* Without any enabled and configured integrations
* Without blackbox and cert exporters
* Without promxy
* Without autoscaling

Full list of default values you can find in `values.yaml` file in `monitoring-operator` helm chart.

To read which parameters can be changed during deploy or update, refer to the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

### Full Stack Deploy

By default, Monitoring is deployed with components without any parameters:

* `alertmanager`
* `grafana`
* `grafana-operator`
* `kube-state-metrics`
* `monitoring-operator`
* `node-exporter`
* `victoriametrics`
* `vm-operator`

To deploy all the components, it is not required to specify any parameters. However, it may be useful to specify
parameters to:

* Create ingresses during the deployment.
* Specify SecurityContext to deploy with a restricted PSP.

For example, to deploy Monitoring into Kubernetes, the following parameters can be specified:

```yaml
grafana:
  ingress:
    install: true
    host: grafana.cloud.org
victoriametrics:
  vmsingle:
    install: true
    ingress:
      install: true
      host: victoriametrics.cloud.org
  vmAlertManager:
    install: true
    ingress:
      install: true
      host: alertmanager.cloud.org
```

All other parameter will be used from default `values.yaml`. The part of default settings described in section
[Default deploy settings](#default-deploy-settings)

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

### Enabling and disabling dashboards, rules and monitors

You can enable or disable Grafana dashboards, Prometheus rules and Service or Pod monitors manually by using the
following parameters:

* [`grafanaDashboards`](#grafana-dashboards): parameter `grafanaDashboards.list` contains names of Grafana dashboards
  that will be installed by the monitoring-operator;
* [`prometheusRules`](#prometheus-rules): parameter `prometheusRules.ruleGroups` contains group names of
  Prometheus rules that will be installed by the monitoring-operator. You can find these groups in the
  [Alerts OOB document](defaults/alerts.md#monitoring-operator).
  Also, you can override each group by `prometheusRules.override` parameter.
  You can find more information in the [alerts configuration document](monitoring-configuration/alerts.md);
* [`kubernetesMonitors`](#kubernetes-monitors): parameter `kubernetesMonitors` contains names of
  Kubernetes monitors that will be installed by the monitoring-operator. Also, you can override `interval`,
  `scrapeTimeout`, `metricRelabelings` and `relabelings` for each monitor. Values will be overridden for each endpoint.

You can enable required and disable useless dashboards, rules and monitors for installation in _public cloud_ with one
parameter. See more in
[Enabling/disabling specific monitoring components](integration/integrations.md#enablingdisabling-specific-monitoring-components).

Also, there is automatic features for disabling specific dashboards and monitors in the monitoring-operator in some
cases. The following rules work for dashboards:

* `kubernetes-nodes-resources` dashboard isn't installed if the `node-exporter` isn't installed;
* `home-dashboard` dashboard isn't installed if `grafana.grafanaHomeDashboard` set as false;
* `core-dns-dashboard` dashboard isn't installed if `coreDnsServiceMonitor` Service monitor isn't installed or
  the monitoring-operator is installed in the OpenShift v3.11 or below;
* `ingress-request-handling-performance`, `ingress-nginx-controller` and `ingress-list-of-ingresses` dashboards aren't
  installed if `nginxIngressPodMonitor` Pod monitor isn't installed or
  the monitoring-operator is installed in the OpenShift.
* `Victoria Metrics` dashboards are installed with VmOperator, VmSingle, VmAlert and VmAgent only.
* `Prometheus Self Monitoring` dashboard is installed with Prometheus only.

The following rules work for monitors:

* `coreDnsServiceMonitor` Service monitor isn't installed if the monitoring-operator is installed
  in the OpenShift v3.11 or below;
* `nginxIngressPodMonitor` Pod monitor isn't installed if the monitoring-operator is installed in the OpenShift.

### Deploy with cert-exporter

#### Types of Checked Certificates

The deployment with `cert-exporter` allows checking ssl/tls certificates and their expiration dates from the following
sources:

* Files on the host file system
* Kubeconfig files
* Kubernetes secrets

##### Certificates from Files

The parsing of certificates from the host file system can be configured by the `certExporter.certsInFiles`
section of the configuration. It is enabled by default.

**Note**: If the collecting of certificates from files, the part of `cert-exporter` will be deployed as a
DaemonSet. You can specify some parameters especially for it by using `certExporter.daemonset` section of parameters.

The exporter can parse default internal certificates from cluster nodes. These types of certificates require Kubernetes
for authentication over TLS and for the Kubernetes cluster to work properly. The parsing of default internal
certificates can be enabled by the `certExporter.certsInFiles.defaultCerts` parameter. By default, the parameter is set
to "true."
This type contains the following certificates:

* For the Kubernetes cluster, files with `.crt` and `.pem` extensions in the `/etc/kubernetes`
  and `/var/lib/kubelet/pki` directories and their child directories.
* For the OpenShift cluster, files with `.crt` and `.pem` extensions in the `/etc/origin` and `/etc/etcd` directories
  and their child directories.

**Note**: The directories with default internal certificates on OpenShift nodes , and on Kubernetes nodes in some cases,
can be read only by the _root_ user. So `cert-exporter` without root rights will not be able to access this part of the
certificates. For more information about this limitation,
see [Installation with Root Rights](#installation-with-root-rights).

Also, you can monitor other certificates from the host file system. To do this, mount custom host path volumes with
the `certExporter.additionalHostPathVolumes` parameter and make regex for matching the certificates of interest with
the `certExporter.certsInFiles.includeCerts` parameter.

For more information about the format of regex, see
[https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar#usage](https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar#usage).

For more information about the configuration of `cert-exporter`, refer to the [cert-exporter](#cert-exporter) section.

##### Certificates from Kubeconfig

The parsing of certificates from the kubeconfig files from the host file system can be configured by the
`certExporter.certsInKubeconfig` section of the configuration. It is disabled by default because kubeconfig files are
usually root readable.

**Note**: If the collecting of certificates from Kubeconfig, the part of `cert-exporter` will be deployed as a
DaemonSet. You can specify some parameters especially for it by using `certExporter.daemonset` section of parameters.

The exporter can parse certificates from the default kubeconfig files. The parsing of kubeconfig files on the default
paths can be enabled by the `certExporter.certsInKubeconfig.defaultCerts` parameter. By default, it is set to "true."
This type contains the following files:

* For the Kubernetes cluster, files with the `.conf` extension in the `/etc/kubernetes` directory and its child
  directories.
* For the OpenShift cluster, files with the `.kubeconfig` extension in the `/etc/origin` directory and its child
  directories.
* For both the clusters, the `/root/.kube/config` file.

**Note**: Kubeconfig files usually can be read only by the _root_ user, so `cert-exporter` without root rights will not
be able to access these files. For more information about this limitation, see
[Installation with Root Rights](#installation-with-root-rights).

Also, you can monitor the kubeconfig files from other paths on the host file system. To do this, mount the custom host
path volumes with the `certExporter.additionalHostPathVolumes` parameter and make regex for matching the files of
interest with the `certExporter.certsInFiles.includeCerts` parameter.

For more information about the format of regex,
see [https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar#usage](https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar#usage).

For more information about the configuration of `cert-exporter`, refer to the [cert-exporter](#cert-exporter) section.

##### Certificates from Kubernetes Secrets

The parsing of certificates from Kubernetes secrets can be configured by the `certExporter.certsInSecrets`
section of the configuration. It is enabled by default.

**Note**: If the collecting of certificates from secrets, the part of `cert-exporter` will be deployed as a Deployment.
You can specify some parameters especially for it by using `certExporter.deployment` section of parameters.

The exporter checks the secret content and chooses the fields that match the given regex (`*.crt` by default). You can
specify the regex for the matching fields in secrets with the `certExporter.certsInSecrets.includeCerts` parameter.

**Important!** The exporter **doesn't use doublestar module to match secrets** for some reason, so patterns we can use
for `certsInFiles` or `certsInKubeconfig` don't work here. It uses [Golang filepath](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath)
notation instead. That means we can't use one parameter to set 2 or more comma separated patterns in `includeCerts`
to match files with different file extensions. But there is the way to avoid this restriction: you can use
`certExporter.deployment.extraArgs` to set additional `--secrets-include-glob` parameters. You can set several secrets
include parameters, and they will work as if they're connected via boolean AND.

The note above means that if you want to watch cert files with `.crt`, `.cer` and `.pem` extensions, you can use the
following configuration:

```yaml
certExporter:
  ...
  install: true
  certsInSecrets:
    enabled: true
    includeCerts: "*.crt"
  ...
  deployment:
    extraArgs:
      - '--secrets-include-glob=*.cer'
      - '--secrets-include-glob=*.pem'
  ...
```

By default, the exporter can parse any types of secrets from all the available namespaces on the cluster. The types of
secrets for checking can be limited by the `certExporter.certsInSecrets.types` parameter. The namespaces for parsing
secrets can be specified by `certExporter.certsInSecrets.namespaces`.

**Note**: You cannot specify more than one namespace at the same time. You can choose only one namespace or all of them.

The exporter can find secrets with specific annotations or labels that can be configured with
the `certExporter.certsInSecrets.annotationSelector` or `certExporter.certsInSecrets.labelSelector` parameters. Also,
the exporter can find and export cert-manager certificates. For more information, see
[https://cert-manager.io/docs/](https://cert-manager.io/docs/).

Different parameters are required for different versions of the cert-manager API due to changes in the way the secrets
were stored. To monitor such certificates, configure the appropriate fields:

* **cert-manager.k8s.io/v1alpha1** `certExporter.certsInSecrets.labelSelector: "certmanager.k8s.io/certificate-name"`
* **cert-manager.io/v1alpha2** `certExporter.certsInSecrets.annotationSelector: "cert-manager.io/certificate-name"`

For more information about the configuration of the `cert-exporter`, refer to the [cert-exporter](#cert-exporter)
section.

#### Installation with Root Rights

For security reasons, some directories and files on the host file system are readable only for root users. In such cases
to collect information about certificates, you need to run the `cert-exporter` daemonset with root rights.

The deployment of `cert-exporter` doesn't need for root rights because it is aimed only on certificates in secrets.

To deploy the exporter with root rights, you should specify `daemonset.securityContext.runAsUser: "0"` in the parameters
in the `certExporter` section:

```yaml
...
certExporter:
  ...
  daemonset:
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: "0"
```

In some cases, the `cert-exporter` without root rights may not have access to some files, although the rest of the files
from the same directory are available. In this case, the exporter signals an error in the pod logs on the corresponding
node, as well as on the Errors panel on the dashboard.

## Integrations

This section describes integrations with various external systems for the following purposes:

* Store metrics for a long term
* Alerting systems
* Visualization of systems

You can find more information about integrations in the [integrations guide](integration/integrations.md).

### Metrics Collectors and Long Term Storages

Prometheus is a system for collecting metrics and getting a prompt response on any unexpected situations. It can store
metrics into an internal TSBD (Prometheus use OpenTSDB). But in the case of a large number of metrics, it is recommended
to use external storage if it is required to store metrics for a longer period, as Prometheus can store metrics only for
a short period like a couple of weeks or months.

#### Common Restrictions and Recommendations

Before you start reading about various integrations and how to configure them, it is important to know the common
restrictions and recommendations.

##### Filter Pushed Metrics

Firstly, if integration uses `Remote Write`, it is strongly recommended adding relabeling config and send only the
metrics that you really want to see. Prometheus can collect 10k or 100k metrics, but it is not required to send them all
to the external storage. Moreover, `graphite-remote-adapter` or the external storage may not withstand such a load, and
start to use a lot of resources or start to skip some metrics.

For example, you can filter sending metrics as follows:

```yaml
prometheus:
  remoteWrite:
    - url: 'http://graphite-remote-adapter:9201/write'
      remoteTimeout: 45s
      writeRelabelConfigs:
        - action: keep
          sourceLabels:
            - job
          regex: (node-exporter|kubelet|kube-state-metrics)
```

In this example, `Remote Write` sends only the metrics with the following labels:

* `job=node-exporter` - Metrics that contains information about VMs.
* `job=kubelet` - Metrics that contains information about pods and nodes.
* `job=kube-state-metrics` - Metrics that contains information about Deployments, DaemonSets, Pods, and so on.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

##### RemoteWrite Increases Memory Usage

Secondly, using remote write increases the memory footprint of Prometheus. Most users report ~25% increase in the memory
usage, but that number is dependent on the shape of the data. For each series in the WAL, the remote write code caches a
mapping of series ID to label values, causing large amounts of series churn to significantly increase the memory usage.

In addition to the series cache, each shard and its queue increases the memory usage. Shard memory is proportional to
the `number of shards * (capacity + max_samples_per_send)`. When tuning, consider reducing `max_shards` alongside
increases to the capacity and `max_samples_per_send`, to avoid inadvertently running out of memory. The default values
for `capacity: 2500` and `max_samples_per_send: 500` constrain the shard memory usage to less than `500 kB` per shard.

For more information about `Remote Write` tuning and which parameters can be used, refer to the official Prometheus
documentation
at [https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/remote_write/](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/remote_write/).

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

##### Add External Labels

Thirdly, it is strongly recommended adding additional labels when using RemoveWrite. These labels allow filtering
metrics for the necessary environment into a central storage.

For example, you can add labels as follows:

```yaml
prometheus:
  externalLabels:
    <key_1>: <value_1>
    <key_2>: <value_2>
    ...
    <key_N>: <value_N>
```

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

##### Use Authentication for RemoteWrite and RemoteRead if Remote Storage Supports it

Some remote storages support authentication on their endpoints. And if a remote storage support authentication, it is
strongly recommended to configure it to avoid store and send data by unauthorized clients.

Monitoring supports two common authentication scenarios:

* Basic Authentication
* Authentication with token

To specify the credentials for basic authentication, specify the following parameters:

```yaml
prometheus:
  remoteWrite:
    - url: 'http://<remote_storage_addr>:<port>/api/v1/write'
      basicAuth:
        username:
          name: your-secret-name
          key: username
        password:
          name: your-secret-name
          key: password
  remoteRead:
    - url: 'http://<remote_storage_addr>:<port>/api/v1/read'
      basicAuth:
        username:
          name: your-secret-name
          key: username
        password:
          name: your-secret-name
          key: password
```

Where, Secret contains the following fields:

```yaml
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: prometheus-remote-storage-basic-auth
type: Opaque
data:
  user: "<username>"
  password: "<password>"
```

**Warning**: Currently monitoring deploy does not allow creating secret with credentials for the external storage. You
should create it manually before the deployment.

To specify a token for authentication, specify the following parameters:

```yaml
prometheus:
  remoteWrite:
    - url: 'http://<remote_storage_addr>:<port>/api/v1/write'
      bearerToken: <token>
  remoteRead:
    - url: 'http://<remote_storage_addr>:<port>/api/v1/read'
      bearerToken: <token>
```

#### Graphite

For integration with Graphite into Monitoring, the chart has the ability to deploy the `graphite-remote-adapter`
service.

The following image illustrates how the metrics are sent during the use of this service in an external server.

![Prometheus to Graphite](images/prometheus_k8s_integrations_graphite_clickhouse.png)

To setup this integration, you need to configure:

* Remote write section into Prometheus. It needs to send the metrics from Prometheus to `graphite-remote-adapter`.
* The `graphite-remote-adapter` section. It contains deploy and runtime parameters for `graphite-remote-adapter`.

For example:

```yaml
prometheus:
  externalLabels:
    cluster: my_awesome_cluster
  remoteWrite:
    - url: "http://graphite-remote-adapter:9201/write"
      queueConfig:
        maxSamplesPerSend: 10000
        capacity: 20000
        maxShards: 30
...
graphite_remote_adapter:
  install: true
  writeCarbonAddress: <carbonapi_addr>:9999
```

Where:

* `http://graphite-remote-adapter:9201/write` is a service name of `graphite-remote-adapter` which Monitoring creates
  during the deployment. So you can always use it to deploy `graphite-remote-adapter`.

The full list of parameters can be viewed at:

* [Prometheus](#prometheus)
* [Graphite-remote-adapter](#graphite-remote-adapter)

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

#### InfluxDB

For integration with InfluxDB into Monitoring, the chart has the ability to specify RemoteWrite and RemoteRead settings.

The following image illustrates how the metrics are sent during the use of this service in an external server.

![Prometheus to InfluxDB](images/prometheus_k8s_integration_influxdb.png)

For more information about the integration with InfluxDB, refer to the official documentation at
[https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/supported_protocols/prometheus/](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/supported_protocols/prometheus/).

To setup this integration, you need to configure the `remoteWrite` or/and `remoteRead` section into Prometheus.
It needs to exchange metrics between Prometheus and InfluxDB.

For example:

```yaml
prometheus:
  externalLabels:
    cluster: my_awesome_cluster
  remoteWrite:
    - url: "http://<influxdb_addr>:8086/api/v1/prom/write?db=<database>"
  remoteRead:
    - url: "http://<influxdb_addr>:8086/api/v1/prom/read?db=<database>"
```

**Note**:

* InfluxDB had some [bugs](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/5610) related to remote read.
  It was fixed since 1.8.x version.
* Prometheus can read only these metrics which it writes or in format which satisfy it conditions.
* Prometheus can't read all other metrics which stored in InfluxDB.
* Prometheus can read metrics only one database.

The full list of parameters can be viewed at:

* [Prometheus](#prometheus)

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

#### VictoriaMetrics

For integration with VictoriaMetrics into Monitoring, the chart has the ability to specify RemoteWrite settings.

The following image illustrates how the metrics are sent during the use of this service in an external server.

![Prometheus to VictoriaMetrics](images/prometheus_k8s_integration_victoriametrics.png)

To setup this integration, you need to configure:

* The Remote write section into Prometheus. It needs to send the metrics from Prometheus to VictoriaMetrics.

For example:

```yaml
prometheus:
  externalLabels:
    cluster: my_awesome_cluster
  remoteWrite:
    - url: "http://<victoriametrics_addr>:8428/api/v1/write"
      queueConfig:
        maxSamplesPerSend: 10000
        capacity: 20000
        maxShards: 30
```

The full list of parameters can be viewed at:

* [Prometheus](#prometheus)

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

#### Prometheus Federation

The Prometheus Federation allows a Prometheus server to scrape a selected time series from another Prometheus server. So
there are two options to setup Prometheus Federation:

* To collect metrics by Prometheus in Monitoring from any other Prometheus.
* To collect metrics by any external Prometheus from Prometheus in Monitoring.

To configure metrics collection by any external Prometheus from Prometheus in Monitoring, no actions are required during
the deployment. All parameters should be configured on an external Prometheus. For an external Prometheus, use any
vanilla image without a configuration manager. For more information, refer to the official documentation at
[https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/#configuring-federation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/#configuring-federation).

Also need add settings for external labels in Prometheus. Prometheus will add these labels for all metrics which
try to collect external systems.

For example:

```yaml
prometheus:
  externalLabels:
    cluster: my_awesome_cluster
```

To configure metrics collection by Prometheus in Monitoring from any other Prometheus, create a ServiceMonitor custom
resource.

The following image illustrate how the metrics is scraped from any other Prometheus:

![Prometheus Federation](images/prometheus_k8s_integration_prometheus_federation.png)

For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: monitoring
  name: AnyInternalPrometheus
spec:
  endpoints:
    - interval: 30s
      port: web
      path: /federate
      params:
        - 'match[]':
            - '{job="prometheus"}'
            - '{__name__=~"job:.*"}'
  jobLabel: federate
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus
```

The full list of parameters can be viewed at:

* [Prometheus](#prometheus)

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

### Alerting Systems

#### External AlertManager

##### AlertManager in the same Cloud

**Note**: AlertManager may not be deployed with Monitoring stack for integration with an external AlertManager.

The AlertManager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus/Victoriametrics server.
It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integration such as email,
PagerDuty, or OpsGenie. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.

There are two options to deploy AlertManager:

* Deploy it into cloud.
* Deploy on any external server as a service or a docker.

During work with external AlertManager, Prometheus calculates the rules and sends only events to the AlertManager. The
AlertManager should handle these events and send alerts as notifications by any configured channel.

To configure the integration with AlertManager, which deploys into the same cloud, specify the parameters into
the `alerting` section in the Prometheus and into the `vmAlertManager` section in the Victoriametrics. For example:

```yaml
prometheus:
  alerting:
    alertmanagers:
      - namespace: upstream-monitoring
        name: alertmanager-example
        port: web
```

```yaml
victoriametrics:
  vmAlertManager:
    install: true
```

Where:

* `namespace` is a namespace where external AlertManager is deployed.
* `name` is a name of an external AlertManager's service.
* `port` is a name of a port in an external AlertManager's service.

##### AlertManager outside the Cloud

To configure the integration with AlertManager, which deploys on any external machine, use
`AdditionalAlertManagerConfigs`. It is a Secret with name `additional-alertmanager-configs`, which is created into the
namespace with monitoring with deploy Monitoring stack.

**Note**: Currently, a deployment process of monitoring stack does not provide the ability to fill this Secret. It is
always created empty and may be filled manually after the deployment.

In Secret, you can specify a part of Prometheus config file with AlertManager settings. For example:

```yaml
- scheme: https
  static_configs:
    - targets:
        - "alertmanager.example.outside.cloud.org"
  tls_config:
    insecure_skip_verify: true
```

Remember that the Secret data should be encoded by base64 to store into secret. For example, in Linux the following
command can be used to encode content of the file with config:

```bash
cat alertmanager.yaml | base64
```

All configurations from `AdditionalAlertManagerConfigs` are applied automatically and without restarting Prometheus.

## Storage

**Note**: Ability to specify storage was added since version `0.4.0`

To maintain data across deployments and version upgrades, the data must be persisted to some volume other
than `emptyDir`, allowing it to be reused by Pods after an upgrade.

Kubernetes supports several kinds of storage volumes. The Monitoring Operator uses Prometheus/Victoriametrics Operator
to control the Prometheus/Vicoriametrics deployment.
The Prometheus/Vicoriametrics Operator works with `PersistentVolumeClaims`, which supports the underlying
`PersistentVolume` to be provisioned when requested.

This document assumes a basic understanding of `PersistentVolumes`, `PersistentVolumeClaims`, and their provisioning.

### Known issues

If you deploy monitoring with Prometheus Operation with version `v0.34.0` or less, you may get problems described in the
following GitHub issue:

* Creation/Update of Prometheus object throws error on volume claim template creationTimeStamp being null. For more
  information, refer
  to [https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues/2824](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues/2824)
* Setting podMetadata labels without creation timestamp fails from golang. For more information, refer
  to [https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues/2399](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues/2399)

This issue was fixed since version `v0.35.0`. To create volume in an older version, you need to manually
add `creationTimeStamp` to `volumeClaimTemplate`.

For example:

```yaml
prometheus:
  ...
  storage:
    volumeClaimTemplate:
      metadata:
        creationTimestamp: '2020-06-23T18:55:02Z'
      spec:
        ...
```

Also if you want to use a `hostPath` with non default users (which you can specify with using `securityContext`), you
may get problems described in the following GitHub issues:

* Permission denied writing to mount using volumeClaimTemplate. For more information, refer
  to [https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues/966](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues/966)
* mkdir /prometheus/wal: permission denied. For more information, refer
  to [https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/12176](https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/12176).

These problems occur because the Dockerfile of vanilla Prometheus image contains the following logic:

* Without `USER` directive (it means under `root`), create a directory for the Prometheus data.
* Changes ownership and grants it to a user and group `nobody` (uid:gid = 65534:65534).
* Execute directive `USER nobody` and run entrypoint under user `nobody`.

It means that the directory is available only for the user `nobody` (65534).

But if you still need to run with a custom user, you must create `prometheus-db` in PV folder and own it to a custom
user. For example, if hostPath PV is created in the directory `/mnt/data/prometheus/` you should create a directory as:

```bash
/mnt/data/prometheus/prometheus-db
```

and own it to user, for example with uid and gid `2001:2001`:

```bash
chown -R 2001:2001 /mnt/data/prometheus
```

### Storage with Dynamic Provisioning

Automatic provisioning of storage requires an already existing `StorageClass`.

For best results, use volumes that have high I/O throughput.

The `StorageClass` that was created can be specified in the storage section in the Prometheus/Victoriametrics resource:

```yaml
prometheus:
  storage:
    volumeClaimTemplate:
      spec:
        # Specify storage class to create volume
        storageClassName: nfs-dynamic-provisioning
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 10Gi
```

```yaml
victoriametrics:
  vmSingle:
    storage:
      # Specify storage class to create volume
      storageClassName: nfs-dynamic-provisioning
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app.kubernetes.io/name: vmsingle
      volumeName: data-victoriametrics-pv
```

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

### Manual Storage Provisioning

The monitoring deploy parameters allow you to support arbitrary storage through a PersistentVolumeClaim.

The easiest way to use a volume that cannot be automatically provisioned (for whatever reason) is to use a label
selector alongside a manually created PersistentVolume.

For example, using `hostPath` persistence volume might be accomplished with the following specifications:

```yaml
prometheus:
  # Vanilla Prometheus image use user and group nobody = 65534
  # So for use PV it is better to use user nobody = 65534
  securityContext:
    fsGroup: 65534
    runAsUser: 65534
  # Because hostPath PV created on specific node, we must bind Prometheus on this node
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: worker1
  storage:
    volumeClaimTemplate:
      spec:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 10Gi
        selector:
          # Match PV by label on PV
          matchLabels:
            app: prometheus
```

```yaml
victoriametrics:
  vmSingle:
    storage:
      storageClassName: manual
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi
      selector:
        # Match PV by label on PV
        matchLabels:
          app: victoriametrics
```

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

### Disabling Default StorageClasses

To manually provision volumes (as of Kubernetes 1.6.0), you may need to disable the default StorageClass that is
automatically created for certain Cloud Providers.

The default StorageClass behavior overrides manual storage provisioning, preventing PersistentVolumeClaims from
automatically binding to manually created PersistentVolumes.

To override this behavior, you must explicitly create the same resource, but set it to not be default.

For example, to disable default StorageClasses on a minikube, edit the following StorageClass:

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: kube-system
  name: standard
  annotations:
    # disable this default storage class by setting this annotation to false.
    storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "false"
  labels:
    addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode: Reconcile
provisioner: k8s.io/minikube-hostpath
```

### auth

Auth is a specification of the desired behavior of the authentication for Grafana, Prometheus, and AlertManager.

**Important**: Old versions of Prometheus and AlertManager has no authentication. So by default (without setup oAuth)
Prometheus and AlertManager will not have any authentication, and in Grafana will be enable Basic Auth with default
credentials (admin / admin).

**Note**: Pay attention that Secret which will store certificates should be created manually. For example you
can create it with using a template:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  trusted-ca.crt: <ca_certificate_content>
  client-cert.crt: <client_certificate_content>
  client-key.key: <client_key_content>
kind: Secret
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: grafana-client-certificates
  name: grafana-client-certificates
type: Opaque
```

Example:

```yaml
auth:
  clientId: xxx
  clientSecret: xxx
  loginUrl: http://1.2.3.4/authorize
  tokenUrl: http://1.2.3.4/token
  userInfoUrl: http://1.2.3.4/userinfo

  ## Settings for TLS
  tlsConfig:
    caSecret:
      name: grafana-client-certificates
      key: trusted-ca.crt
    certSecret:
      name: grafana-client-certificates
      key: client-cert.crt
    keySecret:
      name: grafana-client-certificates
      key: client-key.key
    insecureSkipVerify: false
```

Grafana reads `clientId` and `clientSecret` from Grafana Custom Resource or from environment variables.
Since storing credentials information in Custom Resource is not recommended,
it is necessary to read `clientId` and `clientSecret` from grafana environment variables.
System will automatically populate `GF_AUTH_GENERIC_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GF_AUTH_GENERIC_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
environment variables via `grafana-extra-vars-secret` using the values from `.Values.auth` section.

### blackbox-exporter

Blackbox exporter allow to execute probe to URL (static or for Ingress) as to black box and meter state of answer,
code and response time. Also Blackbox exporter check SSL certificate state (if probe configure for URL
with SSL certificate).

Details, how to configure Probes for use with Blackbox exporter please read in
[Configuration documentation](configuration.md#probe).

### cloudwatch-exporter

cloudwatchExporter is a specification of the desired deployment of cloudwatch-exporter.

**Note**: Pay attention to settings that can be specified under the `cloudwatchExporter.config` parameter, such as,

```yaml
cloudwatchExporter:
  serviceMonitor:
    interval: 2m
  config:
    period_seconds: 120
    delay_seconds: 60
```

These parameters are very important to get the actual metrics from CloudWatch without a delay. The default values of
`delay_seconds` is `600 s`, and this parameter is used to avoid collecting data that has not fully converged.
`600 s` specifies that the exporter fetches data only after `600 s = 10 m`. To decrease the delay, it is recommended
to decrease the value to `60 s`. This time is enough for CloudWatch to collect the metrics and allows
cloudwatch_exporter to fetch them.

Refer to the official documentation of cloudwatch_exporter for full descriptions of all parameters at
[https://github.com/prometheus/cloudwatch_exporter#configuration](https://github.com/prometheus/cloudwatch_exporter#configuration).

#### grafana-image-renderer

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
**Warning**: The grafana-image-renderer requires two extra environment variables in Grafana:

* GF_RENDERING_SERVER_URL - `http://<image-renderer-address>:<port>/render`
* GF_RENDERING_CALLBACK_URL - `http://<grafana-adderss>:<port>/`

These variables have been set by default for local renderer and Grafana services. You don't have to override them. You
need change them in case if youare yousing external renderer.

**Warning**: Rendering images requires a lot of memory, mainly because Grafana creates browser instances in the
background for the actual rendering. If you are going to render a lot of panels it make sense allocate much more memory
than default value(developers of plugin suggest 16GB ram).

**Note**: Pay attention that to enable metrics collection from ingress-nginx, you need open port 10254, for example
with `prometheus` name.

```yaml

kind: DaemonSet
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: ingress-nginx-controller
...
- name: prometheus
  ...
  containerPort: 10254
  protocol: TCP
...
```

Example:

```yaml

  - sourceLabels:
      - pod_name
    targetLabel: pod

### network-latency-exporter

**Important**: In some cases, TCP and UDP probes can show large packet loss not due to network problems, but due to system
settings. The `net.ipv4.icmp_ratelimit` kernel parameter with a default value of `1000` prevents a node from sending "
ICMP time in-transit exceeded" reply immediately, so `mtr` utility which is used in `network-latency-exporter` shows
losses.

Address **Important**: Please note that memory consumption by network-latency-exporter depends on number of nodes where
exporter will be installed and depends on number of using protocols.

The main formula is:

```bash
10Mi + (5Mi * (<number_of_nodes_in_cluster> - 1) * <number_of_protocols>)
```

_To avoid this behavior, set kernel variable `net.ipv4.icmp_ratelimit = 0` on all nodes._

Example:

```yaml
  vmAlertManager:
    install: true
    ingress:
      host: vmalertmanager.test.org
      install: true
    paused: false
    selectAllByDefault: true
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 2001
      fsGroup: 2001
    secrets:
      - kube-etcd-client-certs
    volumes: {}
    volumeMounts: {}
```

If TLS is enabled for Victoriametrics:

```yaml
victoriametrics:
  tlsEnabled: true
  vmAlertManager:
    install: true
    ingress:
      host: vmalertmanager.test.org
      install: true
    paused: false
    selectAllByDefault: true
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 2001
      fsGroup: 2001
    secrets:
      - kube-etcd-client-certs
    volumes: {}
    volumeMounts: {}
    tlsConfig:
      existingSecret: "vmalertmanager-tls-secret"
    webConfig: # optional
      tls_server_config:
        cert_secret_ref:
          key: tls.crt
          name: vmalertmanager-tls-secret
        key_secret_ref:
          key: tls.key
          name: vmalertmanager-tls-secret
```

**Note**
In above case, it is assumed that there is already a secret with the name `vmalertmanager-tls-secret`
present in the server with valid certificates.

    passwordRef:
      key: pass
      name: vmauth-secret
```

If targetRefs is empty - targetRefs for vmalert, vmalertmanager, vmagent and vmsingle will be automatically created.
Default paths for vmalert:

* /api/v1/rules
* /api/v1/alerts
* /api/v1/alert.*
* /vmalert.*

Default paths for vmalertmanager:

* /api/v2/alerts.*
* /api/v2/receivers.*
* /api/v2/silences.*
* /api/v2/status.*

**TODO:** At this moment, you can navigate to the VMAlertManager UI through its Ingress, without using VMAuth, because
VMAlertManager is unavailable via VMAuth Ingress. We need to configure separated routing for it based on another Ingress
or on changing the UI with references to VM components.

Default paths for vmagent:

* /target.*
* /service-discovery.*
* /api/v1/write
* /api/v1/import.*
* /api/v1/target.*

Default paths for vmsingle:

* /vmui.*
* /graph.*
* /api/v1/label.*
* /api/v1/query.*
* /api/v1/rules
* /api/v1/alerts
* /api/v1/metadata.*

In case of OAuth + vmauth `Basic Auth` is supported only.
If OAuth is going to be installed - username (field "username: vmauth" in the example above) is to match the OAuth one,
auth `basicAuthPwd` field is to contain vmauth password.
Here is the config example.

> **Note:**
>
> If you skip parameters `username` and `password` they should be automatically set with default values `admin/admin`.

```yaml
   vmAuth:
     install: true
     ingress:
       install: true
       host: vmauth.test.org

#### TLS Config

TLSConfig holds SSL/TLS configuration attributes.
The parameters are required if SSL/TLS connection is required between Kubernetes cluster and Victoriametrics.
This section is applicable only if `victoriametrics.tlsEnabled` is set to `true`.

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

**Note:**
`*-tls-secret` in the above section represents various names of secrets depending on the Victoriametrics components.
For example, when TLSConfig is configured for `vmagent`, the default name of the secret would be `vmagent-tls-secret`.

If some requests.sql query is incorrect(e.g. request to non-existent table)
the appropriate error will be printed and no queries will be executed.

If requests.metrics.label is not defined, use as labels:

1. Named group of regexp
2. Column name of sql request results

#### http requests collector parameters

HTTP requests collector can send `GET` and `POST` requests and parse responses with `Content-Type` of `application/json`
and `text/plain`.

To one endpoint (`url`) can be sent one or more requests. A Prometheus metric can be different for different requests.
If `metricName` is not filled, the results will be stored in metric with default name `http_collected_versions` with
configured `labels`. `labels` section is required and `label.name` must be unique.

If `Content-Type` of response is `application/json`, `label.jsonPath` value applied to this json and regular expression
`label.valueRegexp` applied to result of jsonpath search.
If `Content-Type` of response is `text/plain`, `label.valueRegexp` applied to result.

The parameters of `HTTP collector` should be provided under the section:

```yaml
version_exporter:
  #...
  exporterConfig:
    #...
    http_collector:
      connections:
      # list of connections
```

          name: secret-certificate-authority
      credentials:
        username:
          key: user
          name: version-exporter-extra-vars-secret
        password:

          name: version-exporter-extra-vars-secret
      requests:
        - path: /version
          method: get
          metricName: "versions_ci_metric"
          metrics:
            - jsonPath: $.buildDate
              labels:
                - name: buildDate
                  valueRegexp: "[a-z0-9.]*"

              labels:
                - name: gitCommit
        - path: /product_versions
          method: get
          metricName: "versions_ci_product_metric"
          description: "Metric shows versions of product components"
          metrics:
            - jsonPath: $.go.goVersion

                - name: goVersion
    - url: https://255.255.255.255:6300
      tlsConfig:
        tlsSkip: true
      credentials:
        token:
          key: token
          name: version-exporter-extra-vars-secret
      requests:
        - path: /version
          method: get
          metricName: "versions_ci_product_metric"
          metrics:
            - jsonPath: $.platform
              labels:
                - name: platform
                  valueRegexp: "[a-z0-9.]*"
        - path: /thirdparty_versions
          method: get
          metricName: "thirdparty_versions_ci_metric"
          metrics:
            - jsonPath: "{range .plugins[*]}{.name}{.version}{end}"
              labels:
                - name: component_name
                  valueRegexp: "[a-z0-9.]*"
                - name: version
```

The jsonpath library used here is `https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath`

If you need to collect metrics with some empty values, use "{range ...} ... {end}" function.
Some examples of range-end jsonpath function:

```json
{range .plugins[*]}{.unique_id}{.name}{.version}{end}
```

or

```json
{range @[*]}{.name}{.version}{end}
```

Be careful, jsonpath with range function should not have plain text symbols, because version-exporter can not parse it.
Example of unsupported case:

```json
{range .items[*]}[{.metadata.name}, {.status.capacity}] {end}
```

#### ConfigMap collector parameters

ConfigMap collector is able to collect data from K8s resources such ConfigMaps and Secrets and
exposes it as prometheus metrics.

The parameters of `ConfigMap collector` should be provided under the section:

```yaml
version_exporter:
  #...
  exporterConfig:
    #...
    configmap_collector:
      defaults:
        # Default values to search k8s resources and take data from them
      resources:
        - name: # Unique name of searching resource (or group of resources)
          # Values that overrides the default section
        - #...
```

**Note**: Almost all the default parameters are required fields.

You can use `name` or `labels` to find ConfigMaps or Secrets you are looking for.
If you declare the empty `resourceLabels` parameter, collector will search resources with the same name as in the
`resources[N].name` field in each of the specified namespaces.

If the `resourceLabels` is not empty, collector will search resources that contain labels from this parameter.
You should declare labels as `map[string]string`. Each label is AND connected.
In this case the `resources[N].name` will NOT be used for searching resources (if `resourceLabels` is not empty,
you can use fake `resources[N].name`), but every item of the `resources`
list must contain this field, and it should be unique anyway.

Parameter `namespaces` allows to specify namespaces for searching resources. Empty list means that resources will be
searched in all namespaces.

Collector parses and processes data from ConfigMaps and Secrets with regular expressions from the `labels` sections.
Configuration must contain at least one item in the `labels` list. Each item must contain unique `name` that will be
used as label name for Prometheus metrics, and must contain either `keyRegexp` or `valueRegexp`.

The data in ConfigMaps and Secrets is a `map[string]string` where each field has a key and a value.
When you specify parameter `keyRegexp` for label item, it means that collector will parse _keys_ from the data with
regexp from the parameter. If you specify `valueRegexp`, collector will parse _values_ with this regexp.

For example, collector found ConfigMap with follow content:

```yaml
...
data:
  example-app: v0.0.1
  ...
```

Configuration of the collector contains follow statements:

```yaml
...
  metricName: configmap_collected_versions
  labels:
    - name: app_name
      keyRegexp: ".*"
    - name: app_version
      valueRegexp: ".*"
```

Then exposed metrics will contain the follow one:

```bash
configmap_collected_versions{...app_name="example-app",app_version="v0.0.1"}
```

Example of configuration:

```yaml
configmap_collector:
  defaults:
    type: configmap
    namespaces: ["monitoring"]
    resourceLabels: {}
    metricName: "configmap_collected_versions"
    description: "Metric shows version collected from configmaps"
    labels:
      - name: key_label
        keyRegexp: "[a-z0-9.]*"
      - name: value_label
        valueRegexp: ".*"
  resources:
    # Collector will search configmaps with label "label-key: label-value" in all namespaces
    - name: version-configmap-test
      namespaces: []
      resourceLabels:
        label-key: label-value
      metricName: "configmap_versions"
      description: "Help for Prometheus metric"
      labels:
        - name: version_from_key
          keyRegexp: "version-app-*"
    # Collector will search secret with name "version-secret-test" in the "monitoring" namespace
    - name: version-secret-test
      type: secret
    # Collector will search configmap with name "version-default-configmap" in the "monitoring" namespace
    - name: version-default-configmap
```

### SSH collector parameters

SSH collector is able to collect data over ssh by requests provided in configuration and
exposes it as prometheus metrics.

The parameters of `SSH collector` should be provided under the section:

```yaml
version_exporter:
  #...
  exporterConfig:
    #...
    ssh_collector:
      connections:
      # list of connections
```

# Deploy

## Admission Migration

Since Kubernetes v1.20 Pod Security Policy (PSP) has been deprecated and will be deleted in Kubernetes 1.25
the migration procedure from PSP to another solution is very important.

The Pod Security Standard privileged policy is required for the monitoring system.
It can be defined on namespace level:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: my-privileged-namespace
  labels:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: latest
```

After migrating but before upgrade monitoring system, please delete all secrets with name like "sh.helm*"

## CRD Upgrade

The upgrade of CRD happens automatically via pre-deploy scripts.

**NOTE:** Automation CRD upgrade requires the corresponding cluster rights for deploy user:

```yaml
- apiGroups: ["apiextensions.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["customresourcedefinitions"]
  verbs: ["get", "create", "patch"]
```

To disable this feature you need to add parameter `DISABLE_CRD: true`.

## Cleanup VictoriaMetrics Objects

Objects were created by victoria-metrics-operator have finalizers. They must be removed manually before clean
installation on cloud with victoria-metrics stack.

You can use this commands. Don't forget change namespace `-n <namespace>`:

## Upgrade

This section contains information about some actions that you may do during upgrades.

### Upgrade from 0.50.0 version

If you are trying to upgrade `monitoring-operator` with `prometheus-adapter-operator`
from older version to `0.50.0` or higher, it will be necessary to perform some manual steps.

Older version of `prometheus-adapter-operator` installed `APIService` object from the operator.
Since `0.50.0`, `APIService` object will be created by `Helm`.
During rolling update, `Helm` cannot replace already created `APIService` with new one.
It is necessary to manually delete the `APIService` object created by the operator using below command.

```bash
kubectl delete apiservice v1beta1.custom.metrics.k8s.io
```

After this, rolling update can be performed and `Helm` is going to create new `APIService` object.

## Manual Deploy using Helm

**Note**: If you want to deploy the `monitoring-operator` into **Kubernetes v1.15** or lower or
**OpenShift v3.11** or lower, you must work with _v1beta1_ CRDs manually. For more information see
[Maintenance Guide: Work with legacy CRDs](maintenance.md#work-with-legacy-crds).

This chart installs Monitoring Operator which can create/configure/manage Prometheus/Victoriametrics and the components
in Kubernetes/OpenShift.

### Ingress using Helm

Ingress is enabled by default.
If you want `host` to be installed automatically, you have to specify next parameters:

```yaml
CLOUD_PUBLIC_URL: <public_url.com>
NAMESPACE: <monitoring>
```

Ingress `host` will be set such as `<component>-{{ .Values.NAMESPACE }}.{{ .Values.CLOUD_PUBLIC_URL }}`.
For example, grafana-monitoring.public_url.com, victoriametrics-monitoring.public_url.com, etc.

Also, you can specify ingress structure for each component. For example:

```yaml
grafana:
  ingress:
    host: <grafana.example.com>

alertmanager:
  ingress:
    install: false
```

### Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `monitoring-operator`:

```bash
helm install monitoring-operator charts/monitoring-operator
```

The command deploys monitoring-operator on the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster in the default configuration. The
configuration section lists the parameters that can be configured during the installation.

The default installation includes Victoriametrics Operator, AlertManager, Exporters, and configuration for scraping the
Kubernetes/OpenShift infrastructure.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

### Upgrading the Chart

To upgrade the chart with the release name `monitoring-operator`:

```bash
helm upgrade monitoring-operator charts/monitoring-operator
```

The command upgrades monitoring-operator on the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster in the default configuration. The
configuration section lists the parameters that can be configured during the upgrade.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-content)

### Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall the `monitoring-operator` deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall monitoring-operator
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes/OpenShift components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

**Warning**: Note that this step removes CRDs for monitoring and deleting these CRDs causes the deletion of all
resources of their type. It means that all resources like ServiceMonitor and GrafanaDashboard from applications are
removed.

CRDs created by this chart are not removed by default and should be manually cleaned up:

* Kubernetes

    ```bash
    kubectl delete crd grafanas.integreatly.org
    kubectl delete crd grafanadashboards.integreatly.org
    kubectl delete crd grafanadatasources.integreatly.org
    kubectl delete crd grafananotificationchannels.integreatly.org
    kubectl delete crd alertmanagers.monitoring.coreos.com
    kubectl delete crd alertmanagerconfigs.monitoring.coreos.com
    kubectl delete crd podmonitors.monitoring.coreos.com
    kubectl delete crd probes.monitoring.coreos.com
    kubectl delete crd servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com
    kubectl delete crd thanosrulers.monitoring.coreos.com
    kubectl delete crd customscalemetricrules.monitoring.qubership.org
    kubectl delete crd platformmonitorings.monitoring.qubership.org
    kubectl delete crd vmsingles.operator.victoriametrics.com
    kubectl delete crd vmagents.operator.victoriametrics.com
    kubectl delete crd vmalertmanagers.operator.victoriametrics.com
    kubectl delete crd vmalerts.operator.victoriametrics.com
    ```

* For OpenShift

    ```bash
    oc delete crd grafanas.integreatly.org
    oc delete crd grafanadashboards.integreatly.org
    oc delete crd grafanadatasources.integreatly.org
    oc delete crd grafananotificationchannels.integreatly.org

# Post Deploy Checks

There are many ways to check whether Monitoring is working correctly and collecting metrics after the deployment.
Depending on the selected deploy tool, some common options and some
specific for deploy tool options are available.

## Common Post Deploy Checks

Firstly, you can check that all components are up using the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <monitoring_namespace>
```

For example, a typical Monitoring deployment contains the following pods:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n monitoring
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

Or you can use the Kubernetes Dashboard to see pods and their statuses in the UI.

Secondly, you can check that all Victoriametrics services have the `OK` status at the `/health` probe,
using the following command:

```bash
curl "http://<victoriametrics pod ip or service name>/health
```

or

```bash
wget -O - "http://<victoriametrics pod ip or service name>/health"
```

Thirdly, you can try to select any metrics that are collected by Victoriametrics for a typical deployment.
You can get the list of metrics by the next command:

```bash
curl "http://<victoriametrics pod ip or service name>/api/v1/labels
```

To select the metrics, you can use the next command:

```bash
curl "http://<victoriametrics pod ip or service name>/api/v1/label/<label_name>/values
```

with the metric name in the field `label_name`. For each metric, a non-empty result should be returned.
