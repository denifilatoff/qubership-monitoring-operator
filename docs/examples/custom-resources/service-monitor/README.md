This example show a basic configuration for ServiceMonitor.

```yaml
spec:
  endpoints:
  - interval: 30s
    port: http
  jobLabel: k8s-app
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      k8s-app: sample-service
```

It means that Prometheus/Victoriametrics will collect metrics from service with settings:

* metrics will collect with job with label `k8s-app`
* metrics will collect from all pods with label `k8s-app: sample-service`
* metrics will collect from all discovered pod from port with name `http` with interval `30s`
