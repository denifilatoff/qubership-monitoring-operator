However in some cases filters can be used to specify particular namespaces for monitoring using labels like <code>serviceMonitorNamespaceSelector/podMonitorNamespaceSelector/probeNamespaceSelector</code> in prometheus specifications. Details for these labels can be found in https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/v0.79.2/Documentation/api.md.</p> <p>Now when our namespace is being monitored, usually we are using the following flow.</p> <p>First, check the VictoriaMetrics/Prometheus config.</p> <p>In case of VictoriaMetrics, open Ingress for VMAuth or VMAgent and navigate to <code>/config</code>. In case of Prometheus, open Ingress for Prometheus and navigate to <code>Status -&gt; Configuration</code>.</p> <p>Use the search on the page and try to find the ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor CR name, for example: <code>postgres-exporter-service-monitor</code>. Also, you can check the relabeling rules under the job name. Some of them usually apply as a filter criteria. While executing discovery it created special metadata labels with following syntax name:</p> <pre><code>relabel_configs:\n- action: keep\n  source_labels: [__meta_discoveryname_typeofresource_label_labelname]\n  regex: &lt;label_value&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>For example:</p> <pre><code>relabel_configs:\n- action: keep\n  source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_label_component]\n  regex: backup-daemon\n</code></pre> <p>will filter all containers only with the label on the Service:</p> <pre><code>metadata:\n  labels:\n    component: backup-daemon\n</code></pre> <p>Remember or save the job name for your service.</p> <p>If you already found the problem in this step, then the root cause may be the following:</p> <ul> <li>You forgot to specify the mandatory label <code>app.kubernetes.io/component: monitoring</code> in ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor</li> <li>Sometimes configuration will apply during 30s - 3 minutes. It may be necessary to wait a little longer.</li> <li>Various errors in the ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor</li> <li>Other errors (usually it's very useful to check victoriametrics-operator/prometheus-operator logs)</li> </ul> <p>Second, check the ServiceDiscovery if you found a configuration for your ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor.

However, after a restart, it begins to restart with OOM.</li> <li>The adapter was scaled to 0 replicas for a long time, and after it was scaled up, it started to restart with OOM.</li> </ul> <p>This issue occurs due to the nature of the working of the Prometheus RemoteWrite protocol.</p> <p>RemoteWrite is a protocol based on <code>protobuf</code> for sending metrics from Prometheus to remote storage pr to remote integration. Each remote write destination starts a queue, which reads from the write-ahead log (WAL), writes the samples into a memory queue owned by a shard, which then sends a request to the configured endpoint.</p> <p>The flow of data looks like this:</p> <pre><code>      |--&gt;  queue (shard_1)   --&gt; remote endpoint\nWAL --|--&gt;  queue (shard_...) --&gt; remote endpoint\n      |--&gt;  queue (shard_n)   --&gt; remote endpoint\n</code></pre> <p>When one shard backs up and fills its queue, Prometheus blocks reading from the WAL into any shards. The failures are retried without loss of data unless the remote endpoint remains down for more than 2 hours. After 2 hours, the WAL is compacted and the data that has not been sent is lost.</p> <p>In other words, if you configure RemoteWrite to graphite-remote-adapter, but for any reason, the adapter was stopped, Prometheus sends the data for the last 2 hours when it comes back.</p> <p>It leads to a lot of points that are sent to graphite-remote-adapter, and it has no resources to process it immediately. So a lot of points are written in the cache. The cache size (which usually specifies the counts of records) may read the memory limit and the pods are killed with OOMKiller.</p> <p>To solve this issue, do either of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Increase CPU to 1 vCPU (in some cases to 2 vCPU) and memory to 2-4 Gb (recommended way).</li> <li>Decrease the cache size (there is no information on how much the cache size should be decreased).</li> </ul> <p>To increase the allocated resources, redeploy graphite-remote-adapter using the following parameters:</p> <pre><code>graphite_remote_adapter:\n  resources:\n    limits:\n      cpu: 2000m\n      memory: 4000Mi\n    requests:\n      cpu: 1000m\n      memory: 2000Mi\n</code></pre> <p>Alternatively, you can manually change the deployment of graphite-remote-adapter.</p> <p>To decrease the cache size, redeploy the adapter with the following parameters:</p> <pre><code>graphite_remote_adapter:\n  additionalGraphiteConfig:\n    write:\n      timeout: 5m\n    graphite:\n      write:\n        enable_paths_cache: true\n        paths_cache_ttl: 7m\n        paths_cache_purge_interval: 8m\n</code></pre> <p>Alternatively, you can add/change these parameters into ConfigMap with the name, <code>graphite-config</code>. For example:</p> <pre><code>write:\n  timeout: 5m\ngraphite:\n  write:\n    enable_paths_cache: true\n    paths_cache_ttl: 7m\n    paths_cache_purge_interval: 8m\n</code></pre> <p>Remember to restart the Graphite pod.</p>"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#graphite-remote-adapter-send-metrics-with-delay","title":"Graphite-remote-adapter send metrics with delay","text":"<p>Description:</p> <p>In some cases, the <code>graphite-remote-adapter</code> pod can send metrics to Graphite/carbon-c-relay/other graphite-compatible target with delay.</p> <p>For example, the delay to send metrics can be from 5m to 1h.</p> <p>It is not always an issue with <code>graphite-remote-adapter</code> and tuning the adapter parameters and increase replica count or resources, the target, and its settings may not help.</p> <p>There are a lot of cases when <code>carbon-c-relay</code> that should receive metrics in the Graphite format can't process the entire metrics stream that is generated by <code>graphite-remote-adapter</code>.

This gauge should increase over time if the cluster is healthy. Several healthy members of an etcd cluster may have different total committed proposals at once. This discrepancy may be due to recovering from peers after starting, lagging behind the leader, or being the leader and therefore having the most commits. It is important to monitor this metric across all the members in the cluster; a consistently large lag between a single member and its leader indicates that member is slow or unhealthy.proposals_applied_total records the total number of consensus proposals applied. The etcd server applies every committed proposal asynchronously. The difference between proposals_committed_total and proposals_applied_total should usually be small (within a few thousands even under high load). If the difference between them continues to rise, it indicates that the etcd server is overloaded. This might happen when applying expensive queries like heavy range queries or large txn operations. Proposals pending indicates how many proposals are queued to commit. Rising pending proposals suggests there is a high client load or the member cannot commit proposals. Disks operations The sum rate latency distributions of fsync called by wal and backend Slow Operations The count of slow apply and read index operations Network The rate number of bytes received and sent from grpc clients Snapshot Duration Abnormally high snapshot duration (snapshot_save_total_duration_seconds) indicates disk issues and might cause the cluster to be unstable.

In general, VictoriaMetrics requires ~1KB or RAM per active time series, so it should be easy calculating the required amounts of RAM for the current workload according to capacity planning docs.

Make sure that an IAM OIDC provider is connected to the EKS cluster, or create one. For more information to create an IAM OIDC provider for your cluster, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/enable-iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html.</p> <p>You can also determine whether you have an existing IAM OIDC provider for your cluster using an AWS console:</p> <p>Navigate to EKS &gt; Clusters &gt; your cluster &gt; Details &gt; if <code>OpenID Connect provider URL</code> has a URL, go to the next step.</p> <p>Step 2. Create IAM policies for cloudwatch-exporter to access CloudWatch.</p> <p>Step 2.1. The <code>cloudwatch:ListMetrics</code>, <code>cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics</code>, and <code>cloudwatch:GetMetricData</code> IAM permissions are required, so you can create a policy like the following (for example, named <code>CloudWatchExporterMonitoring</code>):</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"VisualEditor0\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Action\": [\n                \"cloudwatch:GetMetricData\",\n                \"cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics\",\n                \"cloudwatch:ListMetrics\"\n            ],\n            \"Resource\": \"*\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Step 2.2. (Optional) The <code>tag:GetResources</code> IAM permission is also required to use the aws_tag_select feature.</p> <p>Important: The <code>tag:GetResources</code> permission is required to access Resource Groups and Tagging endpoints, like <code>tagging.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com</code>, which doesn't work with VPC. So the aws_tag_select feature does not work with VPC. For the full list of endpoints available in VPC, refer to the official documentation at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/integrated-services-vpce-list.html. If required, use the following policy (for example, named <code>CloudWatchExporterMonitoringTags</code>):</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"VisualEditor0\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Action\": [\n                \"tag:GetResources\"\n            ],\n            \"Resource\": \"*\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Step 3. Create an IAM role for ServiceAccount. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/associate-service-account-role.html.</p> <p>Step 3.1. To find the AWS account ID, navigate to AWS console &gt; IAM. You can find the AWS account ID in the AWS account section.</p> <p>Alternatively, run the following command in the AWS CLI:</p> <pre><code>account_id=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query \"Account\" --output text)\n</code></pre> <p>Let us assume that the account ID is placed in the <code>account_id</code> variable.</p> <p>Step 3.2. To find the OpenID Connect provider for your EKS cluster, navigate to AWS console &gt; EKS. You can find the OIDC provider in the Details section. Copy this value without https:// prefix (format: <code>oidc.eks.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com/id/&lt;cluster_id&gt;</code>).</p> <p>Alternatively, run the following command in the AWS CLI. Replace <code>my-cluster</code> with the name of your cluster:</p> <pre><code>oidc_provider=$(aws eks describe-cluster --name my-cluster --region $AWS_REGION --query \"cluster.identity.oidc.issuer\" --output text | sed -e \"s/^https:\\/\\///\")\n</code></pre> <p>Let us assume that the OpenID Connect provider is placed in the <code>oidc_provider</code> variable.</p> <p>Step 3.3. Let us assume that the service account name for cloudwatch-exporter is placed in the <code>service_account</code> variable and namespace for cloudwatch-exporter is placed in the <code>namespace</code> variable, and execute the following commands for the AWS CLI:</p> <pre><code>export namespace=&lt;cloudwatch_exporter_namespace&gt;\nexport service_account=&lt;cloudwatch_exporter_service_account_name&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Step 3.4. Create an IAM role using the AWS console. Navigate to <code>IAM &gt; Roles &gt; Create role</code>.</p> <ol> <li>Select <code>Custom trust policy</code> and use the following JSON, which replaces all \"variables\" starting with <code>$</code>    with the corresponding values from the previous steps:</li> </ol> <pre><code>{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Principal\": {\n                \"Federated\": \"arn:aws:iam::$account_id:oidc-provider/$oidc_provider\"\n            },\n            \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\",\n            \"Condition\": {\n                \"StringEquals\": {\n                    \"$oidc_provider:aud\": \"sts.amazonaws.com\",\n                    \"$oidc_provider:sub\": \"system:serviceaccount:$namespace:$service_account\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Select the policies for cloudwatch-exporter access to CloudWatch created in Step 2.    (For example, <code>CloudWatchExporterMonitoring</code> and (optional) <code>CloudWatchExporterMonitoringTags</code>).</li> <li>Enter a name for the role (for example, <code>CloudWatchExporterServiceAccount</code>), a description, check the other details.    Click <code>Create role</code>.</li> </ol> <p>Step 4. Deploy monitoring-operator with cloudwatch-exporter and add the following annotation to the created service account by using the <code>.Values.cloudwatchExporter.serviceAccount.annotations</code> parameter or manually:</p> <pre><code>eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::$account_id:role/$iam_role\n</code></pre> <p>Example of parameters during the deployment:</p> <pre><code>cloudwatchExporter:\n  ...\n  serviceAccount:\n    annotations:\n      eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::$account_id:role/$iam_role\n</code></pre> <p>Where, <code>$account_id</code> is the AWS account ID (Step 3.1.) and <code>$iam_role</code> is the name of the role created in Step 3.4. (for example, <code>CloudWatchExporterServiceAccount</code>).</p> <p>Step 5. (Optional) In some cases, you may need to configure the AWS Security Token Service endpoint for a service account. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/configure-sts-endpoint.html.</p> <p>In general, if the Kubernetes version of your cluster is 1.22 or higher, STS endpoint type should be configured as <code>Regional</code>. Otherwise, the endpoint type should be configured as <code>Global</code>.</p> <p>To use the <code>Regional</code> type, add the following annotation to the service account:</p> <pre><code>eks.amazonaws.com/sts-regional-endpoints: true\n</code></pre> <p>Example of parameters during the deployment:</p> <pre><code>cloudwatchExporter:\n  ...\n  serviceAccount:\n    annotations:\n      eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::$account_id:role/$iam_role\n      eks.amazonaws.com/sts-regional-endpoints: true\n</code></pre> <p>Otherwise, replace <code>true</code> with <code>false</code>.</p>"},{"location":"integration/amazon-aws/#using-an-iam-user","title":"Using an IAM User","text":"<p>You can use an IAM user to give permissions to cloudwatch-exporter.</p> <p>Firstly, you should create IAM policies for access to CloudWatch.

The High severity level must be used only when the users are affected by not being able to work due to the problem. High <code>severity: high</code> It indicates an unusual situation that must be resolved immediately. The problem may lead to a critical situation in the future. The Average severity level must be used when the application cannot fix the problem itself. If the issue is not attended to, then it may cause a major problem. Warning <code>severity: warning</code> It indicates potentially harmful situations, a potential problem, or a non-critical issue that requires attention. The Warning level must be used for issues that can wait for a day or two to be fixed or when the application still has the chance to heal itself. <p>Warning! Please pay attention that severity levels (as and all labels) must be in lowercase!</p> <p>In very rare cases, you may use one additional severity <code>information</code>. We are not recommended to use it for regular alerts. For example, you can use this severity in the cases described below:</p> <ul> <li>You need to suppress some part or all alerts, and as a result, you should have at least one active alert for suppression to work</li> <li>You need to have a DeadManSwitch alert. It is an alert that always should be active and always should send notifications. If it stops sending notifications to an external system it means that the original system is dead.</li> </ul> Severity Label Description Information <code>severity: information</code> It indicates a normal situation without any problems.

Make Prometheus snapshot</p> <p>TSDB Admin APIs allows doing snapshots. You should to send POST request on Prometheus endpoint <code>/api/v1/admin/tsdb/snapshot</code>. The request can be sent from local host via Kubernetes ingress (connected with Prometheus) or from Kubernetes pod that has a tool that allows to do POST request (e.g. curl).</p> <pre><code>curl -XPOST http://&lt;your_prometheus_URL&gt;/api/v1/admin/tsdb/snapshot\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"name\": \"20171210T211224Z-2be650b6d019eb54\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Endpoint has optional parameter <code>skip_head=&lt;bool&gt;</code> - skip data present in the head block.</p> <p>NOTE: The snapshot is stored at <code>/prometheus/snapshots/</code> into Prometheus pod.</p> <p>Step 2. Download on local host/another storage in Kubernetes</p> <p>When snapshot is done you should to save on local host or another storage in Kubernetes. It needs to be done because during update from Prometheus to VictoriaMetrics all Prometheus components will be deleted and data will be cleaned.</p> <p>For copying snapshots on local host you can use <code>cp</code> command in <code>kubectl</code> tool:</p> <pre><code>kubectl cp -n &lt;platform-monitoring-namespace&gt; &lt;prometheus-pod-name&gt;:&lt;prometheus-snapshot-path&gt; &lt;path-on-your-host&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>For example:</p> <pre><code>kubectl cp -n monitoring prometheus-k8s-0:/prometheus/snapshots/20231025T141722Z-734900232b68c299 ./snapshot_1\n</code></pre> <p>Step 3. Deploy monitoring</p> <p>The same as installation without keeping metrics. You should disable Prometheus installation and enable VictoriaMetrics components.
